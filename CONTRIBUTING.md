# How to contribute

You should feel free to contribute with Pull Requests.

To help you with your contributions, it is nice to follow this structure when possible:

- When should you use the documented practice?
- What is this practice?
- What are some applied examples? (both right and wrong)
- Why is this the best solution? It's nice to have references here.
- What are other diverging approaches, and why not use them?
